# Markdown Files

## How to use these

These are generic, reusable Markdown files that act as a standard set of operational guidelines and guardrails that you can place into your codebase or give to your AI agent / assistant. They can reside in an "AI-Instructions" or "Documentation" subfolder within your codebase such that they would be automatically included and processed as part of the project's context with vibe coding with AI.
